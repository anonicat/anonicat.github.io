The <b>total number of deads counts around several hundred thousand people</b>, most of whom died in concentration camps, extrajudicial executions or imprisonment.<br><br><b>Prince Juan Carlos de Borbón was named by Franco as his successor</b> in the session of the Francoist Cortes held in July 1969, with the conditions that <b>after the dead of the dictatorship the "unity of Spain" would never be questioned and no responsibility would be demanded for what happened during the Franco dictatorship</b>, among others.<br><br>After his death, the Spanish state began a transition to a democratized monarchical state with an <b>amnesty law for people who had committed crimes during Franco\'s repression</b>. In this way, there were no radical changes in the military/police, or in the judiciary statements.<br><br>All information extracted from <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco" target=_blank>Wikipedia</a> and <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transici%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola" target=_blank>Wikipedia</a>.'
